                    <b>Quantitative coaching:</b> Quantitative coaching: I want to teach business analysts the
                    quantitative skills they need to thrive. I have noticed that the biggest hurdle faced by analysts is
                    the ability to accurately and efficiently analyze data and share their findings. Whether you are a
                    student, analyst, or HR department of a company, I can help you out.
