                    <b>I am a BCG-trained consultant with a passion for data and for meeting new people. </b> My extroverted side is great at connecting with stakeholders to understand the context and key pieces of information. The data geek in me can piece together messy data scattered across datasets and generate new insights. Bringing these skills together, I can provide recommendations based on a holistic understanding of the business. <br><br>

                        <li><b>Problem:</b> client did not know the labor costs of each product, limiting strategical decision-making</li>
                        <li><b>Solution:</b> I estimated labor costs across product lines. Moreover, I identified a gap in the knowledge of physical asset costs (e.g., vans and bikes). Once I calculated the costs and profitability per product line, I showed some of the growth bets of the company and its largest B2B client  were actually not profitable. </li>

</li>
                        <li><b>Solution:</b> I project managed an investigation led by the VP of Global Sales and Revenue. I partnered with local analytics teams to test our product and identify technical issues and sales gaps. After critical technical changes and improved sales guidance, the product grew from €3MM to €10MM within 12 months.</li>
