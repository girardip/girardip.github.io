<h1>About me:</h1>
<p> <div class="main_text_about">
In this page, I highlight four of my most relevant traits. My goal here is to show a big picture that cannot be expressed through a résumé or LinkedIn profile. </p>
<p>To all my co-workers, professors, and friends who helped me identify, put in practice, and improve these skills, thank you very much!

        <b>Leadership</b> comes naturally to me. Before turning 18, I had already co-founded the first club of my high school,
        been chosen by my fellow classmates to deliver the valedictorian speech,
        and been selected to represent my state in the national program Brazilian Young Parliament.
        More recently, I have become an Resident Assistant (RA), and led BSCUE,
        a preparation program for Brazilian students applying to American universities.  </p>
    <p>
        I <b>dream big</b>, and achieve outstanding results. I led the team that reshaped and improved the services offered by BSCUE.
        The program started to offer a complete preparation assistance, providing text and video guides,
        webinars with recruiters of top universities, and individual assistance.
        In high school, I co-founded the first club sthe Model United Nations Club. The club won a
        Best Delegation honor in a national competition and dozens of individual honorable and verbal mentions
        in state and national-level competitions.

        I am an <b>explorer</b>. In high school I decided to apply to colleges in the US
         when no one in my family had studied abroad or been to the US.
         At Carleton, I have taken courses from seven academic departments. Outside class, I have been a board member
         in the Culinary Club, was a board member in the II Hackathon, and am a voting member in the Education and Curricular Committee.
         Over freshman summer, I was Resource Development Intern at CIFOR, an international organization for environmental research,
         in Rome, Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
        I <b>learn fast</b>. I had never heard about the application process or been to an English speaking country
        before the end of my junior year in high school,
        but I got into one of the best liberal arts colleges in the US.
        Nor had I ever been to a hackathon before organizing CarlHacks, but the event was a success and hit a record number of participants
        (many thanks to the other board members!).
        In short, I can quickly adapt to new environments and deliver outstanding results. This is, I believe, my most important skill,
        because it allows me to succeed in any new situation.
