          <h3>Hi, I'm Pedro, an ex-BCG US consultant that specializes in portfolio optimization.</h3>
          <p>I have worked in portfolio optimization projects for clients that range anywhere 15-person family businesses to Fortune 500 companies. My strengths lie in my data skills (I hold a degree in Statistics) and the ability to connect with clients from the C-Level to Jr. Analysts.</p>
		  <p>I am starting my third year as a freelancer. I love being an independent consultant and my clients love my work too. I am proud to say that every single client of mine has requested follow-up projects. </p>

            <h3>Portfolio Optimization for Tourism Client</h3>
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong> My client could not estimate the labor costs of each product, limiting its ability to allocate capital and update pricing. That led to a decline in profitability and the sale of some products at a loss.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> I estimated the distribution of labor costs across product lines through on-site observations and interviews. Moreover, I identified a gap in the knowledge of physical asset costs (e.g., vans and bikes) and calculated a product P&L view which also takes these costs into account.</p>
            <p><strong>Outcomes:</strong> The client identified that their major growth bet was not profitable due to high usage of costly physical assets. They ended the unprofitable contract, saving €0.1MM/year, and implemented a new pricing system based on updated cost information to avoid future losses.</p>
            <p><strong>Skills:</strong> Excel modeling, interviews with 15+ employees</p>

            <h3>Portfolio Diagnostic for Major German Tech Company</h3>
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong> My client was a leading German tech company with several brands undergoing a 2030 strategy overview. It lacked a comprehensive overview of its portfolio to inform long-term investments.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> I created a unified view of demographic, engagement, and monetization data across all brands, identifying the strengths and weaknesses of each brand and providing strategic recommendations.</p>
            <p><strong>Outcomes:</strong> My client used insights to inform investment/divestment decisions and refine their 2030 strategy roadmap.</p>
            <p><strong>Skills:</strong> Data analysis, stakeholder communication, portfolio strategy.</p>

            <h3>Go-to-Market Strategy for Fortune 500 Distributor</h3>
            <p><strong>Employer:</strong> BCG US</p>
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Our client, a major distributor, wanted advice on the negotiation of a new contract with a business partner (group purchasing organization).</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> I analyzed transaction data to estimate the impact of the business partner on customer acquisition as well as potential cannibalization of existing accounts. With that information, I ran a pre-post model on the impact of that business partner on overall sales and profitability. The analyses showed that the partnership had significantly hurt our client’s bottom line.</p>
            <p><strong>Outcomes:</strong> Our client took our recommendation and did not renew the contract, saving $118MM over the following eight years.</p>
            <p><strong>Skills:</strong> Excel modeling, data manipulation, expert interviews</p>
