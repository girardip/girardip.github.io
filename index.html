                <font size="+16">Hi,</font> my name is Pedro and I am a business consultant with five years of experience in strategy roles at the likes of BCG US and Red Bull Germany. Currently I am working as an independent consultant. 
            

            <p class="main_text">

I have an international background, which helps me to quickly adapt to new circumstances and work styles. I grew up in Brazil and went to college in the US and have worked in the US, Italy, Germany, and Brazil. You can get more detailed info in my CV. I am currently offering two types of services. 
                <br> <br>

                <b>Business consulting:</b>

With a degree in Statistics and five years of experience in corporate strategy roles, I can solve complicated data problems and provide practical recommendations to your business. I have worked with companies of all sizes and across many industries. 
                <br> <br>

                <b>Quantitative coaching:</b> I want to teach business analysts the quantitative skills they need to thrive. I have noticed that the biggest hurdle faced by analysts is the ability to accurately and efficiently analyze data and share their findings. Whether you are a student, analyst, or HR department of a company, I can help you out.
